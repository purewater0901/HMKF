# High-order Moment-based Kalman Filter: Nonlinear Kalman Filtering with Exact Moment Propagation

High-order Moment-based Kalman Filter(HMKF) is a nonlinear Kalman filter that uses exact moment propagation method to estimate state from noisy measurements.

## Paper 
coming soon...

## Language and test environment
The main code is written in C++ and visualization code is mainly used Python. However, we also use [matplotlib.cpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) for the simple visualization in C++. Note that we only test our code on Ubuntu22.04.

## Requirements
```
CMake >= 3.22
```

## Getting Started
coming soon..
